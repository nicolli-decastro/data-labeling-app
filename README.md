## 🔐 Google Drive API Setup

This app uses a **Google Service Account** to read and write CSV and image metadata from your Drive.

To enable that, follow this step-by-step guide:  
📄 [Google Drive Setup Guide](./GDRIVE_SETUP.md)

## 📂 Adding New Data

To label your own data:

1. Create a new folder in `Data/` (e.g., `Data/2025_08_01/`)
2. Include:
   - A CSV with item metadata
   - Corresponding image files
3. Push the folder to your GitHub repo (if deploying),  
   or place it in your local file system if running locally.

The app will automatically detect and load available folders.

## 🧩 Streamlit Pages

Every `.py` file inside the `/pages` folder becomes a new page in the sidebar:

- `login.py`: Auth system  
- `welcome.py`: Instructions  
- `labeling_page.py`: Labeling interface
