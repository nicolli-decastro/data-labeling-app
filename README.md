# Data Labeling App â€“ Loss Detection for Retailers

A **Streamlit web application** designed for retailers and researchers to label suspicious items from marketplaces (like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist). The labeled data supports loss detection research by enabling structured annotation of potentially stolen items.


## What This App Does

- Login system  
- Batch labeling interface for images and listings  
- CSV-based tracking for analysis  
- Google Drive integration for dataset storage and syncing  
- Multipage layout using Streamlitâ€™s native support  


## What is Streamlit?

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python framework for building data apps quickly using only Python. It handles all the UI and backend logic automatically, making it ideal for small web tools like this labeling app.

## Running the App Locally

We recommend running this app locally using a **graphical interface** such as:

- **Anaconda Navigator**
- **Visual Studio Code**

For complete instructions, follow the official Streamlit guide:  
ðŸ“˜ [Running Streamlit with Anaconda](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation/anaconda-distribution)

Once your environment is set up, run the app with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Cloud Deployment

You can also deploy this app to the cloud using **Streamlit Cloud**:

- By connecting your GitHub repository  
- Or using Streamlitâ€™s paid option via **Snowflake**

ðŸ“˜ [Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app)


## Google Drive API Setup

This app uses a **Google Service Account** to read and write CSV and image metadata from your Drive.

To enable that, follow this step-by-step guide:  
ðŸ“˜ [Google Drive Setup Guide](./GDRIVE_SETUP.md)

## Adding New Data

To label your own data:

1. Create a new folder in `Data/` (e.g., `Data/2025_08_01/`)
2. Include:
   - A CSV with item metadata
   - Corresponding image files
   - Ensure the CSV includes a column with file names or paths that match the image files inside the subfolder
3. Push the folder to your GitHub repo (if deploying),  
   or place it in your local file system if running locally.

ðŸ“Œ Important:
The only supported way to add data is by pushing it to the GitHub repository using Git.
Do not upload files using GitHubâ€™s web interface, as it cannot handle:
- Large image file sizes
- A high number of files
- Folder structures properly

Also, storing images on Google Drive is not recommended due to API rate limits and delayed file access.

If youâ€™re running the app locally, place the folder directly in your local Data/ directory. The app will automatically detect and display datasets that follow this structure.

## Streamlit Pages

Every `.py` file inside the `/pages` folder becomes a new page in the sidebar:

- `login.py`: Auth system  
- `welcome.py`: Instructions  
- `labeling_page.py`: Labeling interface
